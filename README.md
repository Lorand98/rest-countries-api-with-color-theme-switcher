## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- CSS/SaSS: Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS modules
- Redux
- React Router
- Custom Hooks
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was very useful in terms that I could revise most of the front-end technologies that I studied before.
I learnt the basics of TypeSript during the development of this project. I found Typescript very useful to use for the development of this project, since I worked witha lot of data types and a lot of functional components. With typescript, I could make sure that the communication between my components is correct and that the needed data is provided everywhere.
I learnt the basics of React Router v6, which I used for the implementation of the pagination system and also for the display of the details about countries.
This is my first project where I used theme changer (dark and light mode), which I developed using mixins. The mixins were responsible for the light and dark modes. 
I then applied these mixins for the components that I created.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus mainly on the technologies I'm not confident with: Webpack (I mainly created my React projects using the create-react-app, but I wanna configure the bundling of my future projects manually if possible). 
I would like to master Typescript as much as possible since I found it very helpful.
I also want to take React to the next level, together with Redux.
One of my main weaknesses currently is the testing, and I think that writing correct test is essential for a good developer. For the current project, I wanna create the unit and integration tests retrospectively (I created 2 until to this point, but that is not enough).
I also wanna learn software architacture, architectural and design patterns.
